Project and Report on Analysis Of Cyberbullying Tweets Using Machine Learning Algorithms 

This project aims to develop models capable of 
automatically detecting and flagging harmful tweets or posts that 
may indicate cyberbullying. Using a dataset sourced from 
Kaggle, we applied preprocessing techniques such as text 
cleaning, tokenization, and normalization to prepare the data. 
The dataset, containing over 47,692 labeled tweets, was analyzed 
to uncover patterns of harmful communication online. Machine 
learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), 
Decision Trees, and Random Forest, were implemented to 
classify tweets into categories such as religion-based, gender 
based, and age-based bullying. Models were evaluated using 
metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The results 
demonstrate that Random Forest Regressor achieved high 
accuracy of 86.53%. Also, Random Forest offered interpretable 
results through feature importance. Compared to traditional 
methods, our approach combines high classification accuracy 
with interpretability, making it a practical and scalable solution. 
This work provides an essential foundation for automated 
cyberbullying detection systems, offering insights that can be 
applied to social media platforms for monitoring and mitigation.
